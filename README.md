<H1 style='color:yellow'>The New York Times Instant News Website - Project 3</H1>

<H2 style='color:yellow'>Brief Description:</H2>

This is the third project of the program, and the purpose is to provide a dropdown menu so that users,
can select a section category, and in doing so, will be shown 12 current news articles.

The requirement calls for a responsive design, that accommodates **mobile, tablet, and desktop** environments.

<H2 style='color:yellow'>Technology Used:</H2>

This project uses the following technology:

- HTML
- CSS, Grid
- SASS (variables, mixins, nesting, and partials,)
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Ajax/JSON
- GitHub
- Gulp
- Yarn
- Goodle Fonts

Development tools include:

- Visual Code Studio
- iTerm2

<H2 style='color:yellow'>Personal Learnings:</H2>

This project gave an opportunity to learn how to pull data from a website (NYT), using their API. I then learned
how to read and then manipulate JSON-formatted data. This allowed me to inject HTML into the existing website page.

Besides learning how to use the technology listed above, this project allowed me to understand more, and make better use of HTML parent and child relationships. Instead of putting a class of every tag, I learned how to
style the parent tag, and only style the child(ren) tag(s) when required.

Throughout this project, I had to re-style the website several times, because I never reviewed the requirements in detail, at the beginning of the project. It would have been better to spend an hour up-from, instead of spending hours re-styling.
